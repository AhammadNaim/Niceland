# Niceland

This is a procedural world generator, that is ment to be used as a base for an open world game. Made with Godot 3.1.

The idea is that if someone wants to make an open world game with infinite landscape to explore, they can just grab this project from GitHub and start making their own game over it. The sources are released with MIT-licence, and anyone can use them however they want. No need to give me credit, but if someone uses Niceland for something, I would love to see it.

Features:
* Endless terrain
* Dynamic sky with clouds and stars
* Multimesh trees, rocks, grass and stuff

Grab the sources and have a nice day!
